# Error Checking

The forms employ format checking for the following items:
- Contract Numbers
- Phone Numbers
- Email Addresses
- EIN/SSN/TIN
- Date Formatting
- Date expiration vs date start

Additionally, the forms will force subcontractors to fill out mandatory items in full, if necessary. Take for example, Schedule B: Contractor Responsibility form. It is an optional form, albeit a very complex form. Thus, the item is only mandatory when the subcontractor indicates that they need to fill it out.
