# data

{: .note }    
> When first starting to build this program, I spaghetti coded most of it. While functional, understanding it became a nightmare. Thus, in an attempt to beautify the code a little, I created classes that would house the most important information. 
>
> Data is one such class that never got made. All the functinons that should be inside data are hanging around loosey goosey as pure javascript functions(). For all intents and purposes, imagine them as a class.
