# Editing Flows, Forms, and Templates

This process involved editing through several platforms:
* GitHub - JavaScript scripts for handling the conditional logic involved in completion of the form
* Power Automate - all flows involved in this process
* Plumsail Forms - the front-facing form that actually gets completed
* Microsoft Word - creating Word Templates

See the below links for help on the appropriate software.
