# Editing Flows, Forms, and Templates

This process involved editing through several platforms:
* Microsoft Word - creating Word Templates
* Plumsail Forms - the front-facing form that actually gets completed
* Power Automate - all flows involved in this process
* JavaScript - scripts for handling the conditional logic involved in completion of the form stored on the GitHub repo [https://github.com/TCE-Innovation/Subcontractor-Automation](https://github.com/TCE-Innovation/Subcontractor-Automation)
