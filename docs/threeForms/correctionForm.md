# The Correction Form

The correction form is for TCE internal use only. It is shown below: 
![](/assets/images/correctionForms.png)

Subcontractor name and contract number are drop downs to indicate which submission needs to be corrected. Populate this with the information regarding the subcontractor and contract number of your choice.

Editable items contains two dropdowns: The Form name and the Item that Requires Change. These two items are based on the online form that exists, not the PDF forms. Thus, just like the online Subcontractor forms, some repetitive items may be missing here. 

    The dropdowns may also include items that don't exist in the form, such as "Hide PDF". These can be safely ignored.

If you have found an error in the merged PDF open this page, and fill in this information.
