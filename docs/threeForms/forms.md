# The Three Forms
THere are 3 forms that make up this process: The initialization Form, the subcontractor form, and the correction form. All forms employ the same formatting restrictions, the rules for which can be found on the sidebar.

The initialization form kickstarts the process with a little bit of known good information from the general contractor.

The subcontractor form contains a bulk of the questions, and falls upon the subcontractor to complete.

The correction form is used just in case the subcontractor has messed up content, as that is something we can't check for. We can only verify formatting in the subcontractor forms.
