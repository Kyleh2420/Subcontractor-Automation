<h2>Purpose</h2>

The MTA Subcontractor Form is to be filled out by the subcontractors asked to complete the forms required by the MTA as of Aug. 2023. This collects the information needed to fill out the appropriate forms which will be used to trigger the "Read Subcontractor Form, Generate PDFs, and Send Receipt Emails" Power Automate Flow.

<h2>Overview</h2>

Subcontractors will receive an invitation to fill out this form via email after the prime contractor (ex: TCE) completes the Initialization Form. Upon opening the form from the email, the subcontractor will be brought to the Subcontractor Form with prepopulated data about known information such as the prime contractor name and be asked to complete the form. The subcontractor must complete each form in sequential order and fill in all of the required fields before being able to proceed to the next step. The form ensures that proper formatting and all required fields are complete before submission.

Submitting the form will trigger the [Process Subcontractor Form and Send PDFs Power Automate flow](/flows/processSubcontractorFormAndSendPDFs.html) which will generate the PDFs to be reviewed and submitted to the MTA.

<h2>How to Edit</h2>

Like the Initialization Form and Correction Form, the Subcontractor Form was created using Plumsail Forms and JavaScript. Please see the [Editing with Plumsail](/editingFormsAndFlows/editWithPlumsail.html) and [Editing with JavaScript](/editingFormsAndFlows/editWithJavaScript.html) pages for information on how to edit forms with Plumsail and JavaScript.
